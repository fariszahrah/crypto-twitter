the purpose of this repo is to understand what crypto founders are using their twitter accounts to discuss.
The main goal is to analyze if founders, companies, etc. in crypto are more focused on the price of their tokens or the advancement of their technology.  

The idea for this came from the fact that bitcoin is and has been a quite polarizing subject at the dinner table.
The anti-crypto cohort believes that the entire crypto market is a collection of companies scamming investors.
So now I am attempting to see how these companies use their twitter accounts.

-- Phase-0 uses a bag of words, tokenization, tfidf


-- Phase-1 uses word2vec, currently this is still in development and will be pushed shortly
